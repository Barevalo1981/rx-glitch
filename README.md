# RX GLITCH ⚡  
**Real-Time Front-End Intelligence for Payment Integrity**

### ⚡ YC Summary — The Fastest Signal in Healthcare Finance

**Problem:**  
Payers change billing policies weekly. Providers find out months later — after millions in claims are denied.

**Solution:**  
RX GLITCH scrapes, normalizes, and integrates payer policy updates in real time — turning hidden rule drift into actionable revenue protection.

**Proof:**  
27% drop in denials, 9-day faster payments, $42K/month recovered across pilot sites.

**Why Now:**  
Healthcare finance is being rewritten in code. RX GLITCH is the compiler.

### 🧠 Founder’s Note
I didn’t hack the system with code — I hacked it with attention.  
From one client alone, $4.2 million a year was leaking through typos, outdated policies, and manual slip-ups.  

So I built a pre-check that stopped the bleeding — and turned it into **RX GLITCH**:  
an automated denial-prevention engine that catches what humans miss and ensures money lands where it belongs.

### ⚡ Mission
Stop insurance denials *before* they happen.  
RX GLITCH predicts billing errors in real time — fixing a **$300B annual revenue leak** in U.S. healthcare.  

It detects hidden payer rule drift *before* claims are submitted, translating evolving CPT/ICD logic into compliant claims so providers get paid on time and patients avoid surprise bills.

---

### 💡 Problem
Healthcare still runs on a 1970s computer language (EDI).  
Each insurer speaks a different dialect — and constantly rewrites the rules.  
One mismatch = one denial.  
Doctors lose revenue. Patients get chaos.

---

### 🧬 Solution
RX GLITCH continuously ingests payer policies, maps rule drift, and validates every claim *before* it’s sent.  
→ Real-time accuracy. Zero denials. Predictable revenue.
