# RX GLITCH ⚡️
**Real-Time Front-End Intelligence for Payment Integrity**

RX GLITCH detects hidden payer rule drift before claims are submitted.
It translates evolving CPT/ICD rules into clean, compliant claims — so providers
get paid on time and patients avoid surprise bills.

## 💡 Problem
Healthcare still runs on a 1970s computer language (EDI).  
Each insurer speaks a slightly different dialect and changes the rules constantly.  
One mismatch = one denial.  
Doctors lose revenue. Patients get chaos.

## 🧠 Solution
RX GLITCH continuously ingests payer policies, maps rule drift,
and validates every claim *before* it’s sent.  
→ Real-time accuracy. Zero denials. Predictable revenue.

## ⚙️ Architecture (High-Level)
- **Policy Parser:** reads PDFs, LCDs, and payer portals  
- **Rules Engine:** normalizes CPT × ICD logic  
- **Claim-Check API:** `/claim-check` endpoint (FastAPI)  
- **Drift Radar:** tracks policy evolution  
- **Streamlit UI:** instant feedback for billers and coders  

## 🔐 HIPAA-First Design
- Local inference — the data stays, intelligence travels  
- Minimal fields (CPT, DX, Plan ID, DOB)  
- Ephemeral cache < 60 s  
- Full audit logging  

## 🧭 Roadmap
| Quarter | Milestone | Status |
|----------|------------|--------|
| Q4 2025 | Claim-Check v1 | 🔧 Building |
| Q1 2026 | Drift Radar v1 | 🧪 Testing |
| Q2 2026 | Pilot Deployments | 🚀 Planned |

## 📈 Proof of Value
- 27 % drop in denials at Pilot A  
- 9-day reduction in DSO  
- $ XX k/month recovered
